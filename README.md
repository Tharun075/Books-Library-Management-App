# Books-Library-Management-App
A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application that allows users to manage and track books they’ve read, want to read, or are currently reading. Users can register, log in, add books to their personal library, rate them, and leave reviews — similar to platforms like Goodreads.
